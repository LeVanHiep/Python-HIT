# Python-HIT

A place to put my Python homeworks

## Getting Started:
a. Install some applications:
  1. Install Python package:
-   Unlike C,C++, Python does not create a .exe file and runs immediately. It uses CMD(Command Prompt - a command-line interface programs used to execute commands in Windows operating systems) to execute so you need to install a Python package in order to let your computer understand this language.
-   To install Python package, simply follow these steps (for Windows Operating System):
    -   Click on `Start`
    -   Type `cmd` and press `Enter` button (A black window will pop up)
    -   In that window, type `pip3 install python`
    -   Now, you Computer can understand Pypy babe

  2. A coding enviroment - A place where you can write Python code (Just pick up one of those applications or two):
-   [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
-   [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
-   [Visual Code Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-   [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
-   or even Notebook ( and change the file to ".py")
  3. A IDE program: simply using cmd(Command Prompt), PowerShell or in app IDE.
  4. A place to upload and store my homework: Git
  5. A brain :smile:
